A multiscale simulation for the analysis of the mechanical behaviors of soft biological tissues was developed and implemented using AMSI. The biotissue simulation is currently a two-scale hierarchical multi-scale simulation coupling two continuum analyses. The primary scale (engineering scale) is a macro-scopic simulation using the finite element method on the cauchy momentum balance equation. The tertiary scale is micro-scopic and takes place at every macro-scale integration point (those points where the stress response of the material is queried during the macro-scale simulation) and used to supply the material response. The micro-scale simulation simply conducts a force-balance operation on a randomly generated collagen fiber-network residing inside of a unit cube representative volume element (RVE) which is deformed using the state of the associated macro-scale element, and has appropriate boundary conditions enforced.

The biotissue simulation was implemented by combining two single-scale simulations: a typical parallelized finite element analysis and a quasistatics code. The combination of these two simulations using AMSI was very straightforward, involving the introduction of an initialization and configuration phase for AMSI, wrapping the pre-existing main functions of each simulation in an AMSI scale-task callback, and finally introducing relavant AMSI communcation (and load-balancing) calls at locations where scale-interaction is required. 

The simulation has been run many times on the Amos BlueGene/Q managed by the Center For Computational Innovations at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, and has scaled up to 250k elements at macro-scale with over 16k cores (with >90\% assigned to micro-scale simulations as these represent the bulk of actual computation). Scaling beyond this should be possible but has not currently been conducted. Theoretically the simulation should be able to scale up to around 300 million elements, limited by memory restrictions on the AMOS machine and the memory associated with a single RVE. Scaling to the full machine is however necessary to get a richer understanding of the performance of AMSI.

Symposia on the development and use of AMSI for the biotissue problem have been given at SIAM Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing 2014 and at SIAM Computational Science and Engineering 2015.
