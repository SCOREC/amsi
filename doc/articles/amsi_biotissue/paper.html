<a 
 id="x1-2r1"></a>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >This article predominantly discusses multi-scale simulations - wherein two or more separate
physical scales are involved in the simulation - the discussion is equally applicable to
multi-model simulations - wherein two or more numerical or physical models operating on
the same domain (possibly with differing discretizations) are involved in the simulation - as
well as to simulations which are both.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >
<a 
 id="x1-3r2"></a>
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   Most physical models and implementations using numerical methods operate at a single
scale characteristic to the problem. The scale at which the preponderance of attributes
governing the underlying physics being modelled are measured and the resolution of
the numerical solution is considered acceptable for the desired accuracy of the
simulation.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Introducing multi-scale influences on the scale of interest in a simulation can occur in
several places during the development of a simulation. Most fundamentally, the influence
can be incorporated during the mathematical development of the physical model
itself. In this case the multi-scale features are incorporated into the numerical
implementation automatically, as a result of their presence in the mathematical
model.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Multi-scale influences can also be incorporated in a numerical sense, combining
established physical models operating at different scales referencing and effecting shared
physical fields and values <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xshenoy97">14</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xweinan2003heterogenous">19</a>]</span>. Numerically multi-scale simulations associate many
numerical implementations of single-scale physical models and cause them to
interact by passing key physical terms between scales. This operation, referred to as
scale-coupling, involves up-/down-scaling operations to account for differences in scale
dimensionality (and possibly dimensionalizing terms computed in a non-dimensional
domain).
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   In order for a numerically multi-scale approach to be effective the domain associated
with the scale of interest (or engineering scale) must be sufficiently large that conducting
the entire simulation with terms and granularity orders of magnitude removed would
make the simulation computationally intractable. Thus some computationally
reasonable subset of the engineering scale is assigned tertiary scale(s) to simulate.
The precise choice of location of the tertiary simulations is largely dependent
on the specific numerical algorithms used to implement the engineering scale
simulation.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Often the subset of the domain associated with the tertiary scales are areas of the
engineering domain where the impact of the tertiary scales has the most impact on the
engineering scale simulation, in order to leverage the most utility from the multi-scale
                                                                       

                                                                       
approach.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Numerical multi-scale simulations fall broadly into two categories. In the
concurrent multi-scale paradigm, all scales are computed simultaneously and the
required inter-scale coupling values are provided just-in-time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xzeng2010concurrent">20</a>]</span>. In the sequential
multi-scale paradigm, tertiary scales compute parameters which are converted
to quantities of utility to a primary scale. Each scale (though not necessarily
each scale-task, representing an individual operation or simulation occurring in a
scale) must be processed sequentially <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xgarcia2008sequential">8</a>]</span> and may be blocked on the completion of
the previous scale. This multi-scale model maps intuitively to phased parallel
communication models found in the commonly used bulk synchronous parallel abstraction
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xvaliant1990bridging">18</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >
<a

<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   The Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation Infrastructure (amsi) is a set of libraries and tools
developed at the Scientific Computation Research Center (SCOREC) at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. Amsi is designed to support the implementation and execution of
dynamic numerically multi-scale simulations on massively-parallel HPC machines.
Currently amsi provides interfaces for describing and managing the execution of
individual scales in a multi-scale simulation, for defining, managing and enacting the
scale-coupling communication required by such simulations, and for planning and
enacting scale-sensitive load balancing operations on individual scales in a multi-scale
system.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   The interfaces provided by the amsi libraries are intended to facilitate the coupling of
functional (possibly legacy) simulation codes already in usage for single-scale problems, in
order to avoid development overhead associated with casting a simulation into a set of
framework-specific components. The currently implemented interfaces are physics-agnostic,
operating only on computational quantities with no model of a term&#8217;s relation
to the mathematical derivation of the multi-scale interaction. Incorporation of
meta-information and services targeted toward specific multi-scale physical couplings
represents a desirable extension of the amsi libraries, constituting a rich area of future
work.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Amsi operates by maintaining a set of minimal simulation metadata in order to model
various quantities of interest during simulation execution. A decentralized approach toward
control is taken; dynamic control decisions are made and implemented at runtime during
collective operations. In order to avoid the introduction of unnecessary parallel
barriers into the code, amsi control decisions are only made during operations
which are already collective over the set of processes effected by a given control
decision.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   Frameworks and runtime systems have been developed which are intended for the
development of specific multi-scale problems <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xparker2006component">13</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xchopard2011framework">7</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[]</span> and these frameworks have in some
cases been expanded to facilitate the implementation of additional multi-scale problems
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xberzins2010uintah">5</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   These systems suffer from the requirement that an application developer
must cast the problem of interest into a set of predefined components (interfaces,
tasks, etc.) or specify the problem through a high-level modelling language in
order to take full advantage the services provided by the framework. Leveraging a
component-based design is valuable from a software engineering perspective, but also
introduces new complexities involved in defining the set of components and how
they interoperate in the framework, shifting some complexity up the abstraction
                                                                       

                                                                       
hierarchy. The core features of amsi used for multi-scale simulation management and
communication are provided with no requirements of adherence to a specific component
definition.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Typically simulation flow control is determined solely by the runtime system. A
framework may also limit specific features of the numerical implementation to
those provided by the framework. This includes domain discretization models
and associated adaptive processes &#8211; structured and unstructured meshing and
associated refinement algorithms, particle-in-cell methods, etc. &#8211; convergence
algorithms for both the minimization of the relevant residuals (Newton-Raphson, etc.)
as well as iterative solution of the resulting linear system (KSP, GMRES, ILU,
etc.).
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Amsi supplies several numerical components consisting of an adaptive finite element
system, linear algebraic solver, and nonlinear convergence operators available as both
simple C++ class interface definitions, as well as implementations of these interfaces built
on top of other software supplied by SCOREC <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> for finite element analysis operations as
well as the PETSc linear algebraic solver <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpetsc-web-page">3</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpetsc-user-ref">2</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpetsc-efficient">4</a>]</span>. Usage of the supplied numerical
components is not required to make use of the multi-scale meta-modeling, communication,
dynamic instantiation, and scale-sensitive load balancing facilities supplied by
amsi.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Implementing required numerical operations inside an existing framework is of course
possible, though it may prove an additional &#8211; undesirable overhead for an application
programmer interested only in utilizing the multi-scale framework to implement a
simulation, rather than implementing the various numerical operations often optimized in
widely available packages and libraries.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >

<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   A configuration file is supplied during command invocation containing the initial
configuration of the process sets and their assignment to individual scales, as well as
declaring the coupling between scales in the simulation. The declaration of a scale and the
initialization of the process set associated with the scale are considered a single atomic
operation in the current implementation. A simple configuration file can be seen in
listing <a 
href="#x1-6r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: amsi_config_file --></a> which declares the existence of two scales, macro and micro_fo, and tells
the amsi intialization procedures to assigne them process sets containig 64 and
8128 processes, respectively (for a total of 2<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">13</span></sup> processes). The file also specifies
the scale-coupling relations, with macro coupled to micro and micro coupled to
macro. Note that the order of specification is not relevant to the operation of amsi.

<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Typically creation of this file will be automated and added to the shell script used to
invoke the simulation, so ensure that process counts passed in throught the configuration
file are valid. Alternative specification mechanisms such as ratio specification (equivalently
percentage specification) are being considered for future use to prevent the possbility of
misallocation of processes (the user not specifying assignment for all processes available to
                                                                       

                                                                       
the simulation).
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   Process sets are mathematical sets of MPI ranks implemented so as to take advantage
of any mathematical conveniences to minimize explicit storage whenever possible. Process
sets are required to be non-overlapping in order for amsi control mechanisms to operate
correctly. Ongoing developments are targeted at removing this requirement to allow a richer
set of dynamic control options and increase overall utilization in the case of coupled scales
blocking on one another.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Declaration of a coupling relation between two scales is required if any communication
between the scales is to occur during the simulation (through the amsi libraries), as the
coupling declaration during simulation initialization is used to instantiate data structures
specific to scale-coupling operations. This limits memory overhead by not allocating space
for unneeded coupling operations.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Scales are declared to be related if some quantities of interest (such as physical tensor
field values) are transmitted between them for scale-coupling. This coupling relationship is
assumed to be asymmetric, thus if scale A is related to scale B, scale B is not implicitly
related to scale A, though this may be separately declared.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   While the primary scale (the scale associated with producing the solution for the
overall simulation) is often thought of as controlling the tertiary scales in terms of dynamic
instantiation, this is not assumed in the amsi implementation. Any scale is capable of
informing the process set associated with a coupled scale of the addition or deletion of
individual scale-tasks. At present it is dependent on the developer to implement
the capability of a scale to accept additional scale-tasks, though algorithms and
hooks for developer-designed distribution algorithms are supplied to ease the
implementation.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   Scale-coupling communication is guided by data distributions and communication
patterns. A data distribution is a representation of individual units of scale-coupling
data distributed across a single scale-task. The format of the coupling data is
arbitrary (so long as it can be serialized and provided for use by MPI communication
primitives). A data distribution represents the smallest unit of data important to the
scale-coupling communication, which is necessarily distinct for various multi-scale use
cases.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   All communication and planning operations in the amsi libraries use an implicit local
numbering for data distribution terms, the index associated with the term in a local
serialized buffer. At present an application developer must implement up-/down-scaling
operations required for their particular multi-scale use case, hooks will be provided in a
future release to automate application of such operations during scale-coupling.
The current implementation includes on blocking versions of the scale-coupling
communication operations. Asynchronous versions have been designed but are not currently
being implemented due to lack of immediate need for the primary test amsi use
case.

<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   As the problem size is held constant with respect to the number of individual elements
in the engineering scale domain discretization the simulation displays near optimal
convergence to the macro-scale solve time alone, which is also reducing in time cost. The
limiting factor in the speedup of the overall simulation is the potential speedup of the
macro-scale simulation rather than the micro-scale simulation with fiber-only
RVEs. As indicated in the weak scaling results this is related primarily to the
macro-scale linear solve communication time increasing. At present an incomplete LU
factorization is used to solve the linear system formulated at macro-scale each Newton
iteraion (using PETSc configured with the superLU_dist solver <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xli05superlu">10</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xlishao10superluilu">12</a>]</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xlidemmel03superludist">11</a>]</span> ).
Using instead an iterative solution method to reach a desired level of accuracy
may result in stronger scaling at macro-scale, but as yet this approach has been
unneeded due to the preponderance of time spent computing micro-scale results in use
cases.
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   Many problems of interest will possess finite elements numbered in the tens to hundreds
of millions of degrees of freedom, such that a suitable partitioning of the mesh to cores
on the machine in terms of elements per partition (and directly the macro-scale
time-to-solution) may require a substantial fraction of the total cores on the machine for
macro-scale to execute in reasonable time. Amsi provides services for dynamically adding
and removing individual scale-tasks to a specific scale, which can be utilized to limit RVE
usage to only those locations in the multi-scale mesh most influential on the overall
evolution of the simulation.

<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   The Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation Infrastructure provides a valuable set of tools to
facilitate the implementation and execution of multi-scale simulations without imposing
restrictions on the application developer. Usage of the core operations of the amsi libraries
does not require adherence to a specific set of interfaces nor usage of an abstract
modeling language, which complicate inclusion of legacy components into multi-scale
simulations.
<!--l. 158--><p class="indent" >   Scale-sensitive load-balancing operations have been developed for the biotissue
multi-scale test problem. Unfortunately the problem does not exhibit load persistence in
the current parallel execution space task discretization, so an alternative parallel
discretization such as overdecomposition with work-stealing to enforce more local balancing
operations and occasional global balancing operations is being explored.
<!--l. 160--><p class="indent" >   Development of libraries concerned with higher levels of abstraction of the multi-scale
problem will also be valuable in easing the development of new multi-scale simulations from
the perspective of the application programmer. High level abstractions such as the Scale
Separation Map in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xchopard2011framework">7</a>]</span> could provide mechanisms to provide initial configuration
information to the amsi system during the initialization phase, as well as assist in
the implementation of (or usage of existing library-provided) up-/down-scaling
operations.

alternative to the fiber-only RVE, to be used in areas of the macro-scale domain determined
to be most critical to the overall evolution of the global system, or where error
accumulation through model inaccuracy is to be minimized. As this fiber-matrix RVE
                                                                       

                                                                       
represents a more significant source of computational complexity, it is independently
parallelized &#8211; in contrast to the fiber-only RVE &#8211; and will represent a compelling use case
for the parallel execution space discretization and scale-coupling communication
management capabilities of the amsi libraries.
