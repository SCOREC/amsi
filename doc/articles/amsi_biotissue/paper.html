<a

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >This article predominantly discusses multi-scale simulations - wherein two or more separate
physical scales are involved in the simulation - the discussion is equally applicable to
multi-model simulations - wherein two or more numerical or physical models operating on
the same domain (possibly with differing discretizations) are involved in the simulation - as
well as to simulations which are both.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >
<a

<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Most physical models and implementations using numerical methods operate at a single
scale characteristic to the problem. The scale at which the preponderance of attributes
governing the underlying physics being modelled are measured and the resolution of
the numerical solution is considered acceptable for the desired accuracy of the
simulation.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Introduction of influence from scales orders of magnitude removed from the primary
scale can take place in several different ways. This influence can be incorporated during the
mathematical development of the physical model itself. In this case the multi-scale features
are incorporated into the numerical implementation automatically, as a result of their
presence in the mathematical model.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Multi-scale influences can also be incorporated in a more strictly numerical
sense, combining physical models operating at different scales referencing and
effecting shared physical fields and values <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span>. Numerically multi-scale simulations
associate many numerical implementations of single-scale physical models and
cause them to interact through passing key physical terms between scales. This
scale-coupling will involve up-/down-scaling operations to account for differences in
dimension, as well as possibly dimensionalizing terms computed in a non-dimensional
domain.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   In order for a numerically multi-scale approach to be effective the domain at the scale
of interest (or engineering scale) must be sufficiently large that conducting the
entire simulation with terms and granularity orders of magnitude smaller would
make the simulation computationally intractable. Thus some computationally
reasonable subset of the engineering scale is assigned tertiary scales to simulate.
The precise choice of location of the tertiary simulations is largely dependent
on the specific numerical algorithms used to implement the engineering scale
simulation.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Often the subset(s) of the domain associated with the tertiary scale(s) are locations in
the engineering domain where the impact of the tertiary scales has the most impact on the
engineering scale simulation, in order to leverage the most power from the multi-scale
                                                                       

                                                                       
approach.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   In the concurrent multi-scale paradigm, all scales are computed simultaneously and the
required inter-scale coupling values are provided just-in-time <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span>.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   In the sequential multi-scale paradigm, tertiary scales compute parameters which are
converted to quantities of utility to a primary scale. Each scale (though not necessarily
each scale-task, representing an individual operation or simulation occurring in a
scale) must be processed sequentially <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> and may be blocked on the completion of
the previous scale. This multi-scale model maps intuitively to phased parallel
communication models found in the commonly used bulk synchronous parallel abstraction
<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span>.

<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation Infrastructure (amsi) is a set of libraries and tools
developed at the Scientific Computation Research Center (SCOREC) at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. Amsi is designed to support the implementation and execution of
dynamic numerically multi-scale simulations on massively-parallel HPC machines.
Currently amsi provides interfaces for describing and managing the execution
of individual scales in a multi-scale simulation, for defining and managing the
scale-coupling communication required by such simulations, and for planning and
enacting scale-sensitive load balancing operations on individual scales in a multi-scale
system.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The interfaces provided by the amsi libraries are intended to facilitate the coupling of
functional (possibly legacy) simulation codes already in usage for single-scale problems, in
order to avoid development overhead associated with casting a simulation into a set of
framework-specific components. The currently implemented interfaces are physics-agnostic,
operating only on computational quantities with no model of a term&#8217;s relation
to the mathematical derivation of the multi-scale interaction. Incorporation of
meta-information and services targeted toward specific multi-scale physical couplings
represents a desirable extension of the amsi libraries, constituting a rich area of future
work.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Amsi operates by maintaining a set of minimal simulation metadata in order to model
various quantities of interest during simulation execution. A decentralized approach toward
control is taken; dynamic control decisions are made and implemented at runtime during
collective operations. In order to avoid the introduction of unnecessary parallel
barriers into the code, amsi control decisions are only made during operations
which are already collective over the set of processes effected by a given control
decision.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >
<a 
 id="x1-5r2"></a>
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Frameworks and runtime systems have been developed which are intended for the
development of specific multi-scale problems <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> <span class="cite">[]</span> <span class="cite">[]</span> and these frameworks have in some
cases been expanded to facilitate the implementation of additional multi-scale problems
<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span>.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   These systems suffer from the requirement that an application developer must cast the
problem of interest into a set of predefined components (interfaces, tasks, etc.) in order to
take full advantage of such frameworks. Leveraging a component-based design is valuable
from a software engineering perspective, but also introduces new complexities involved in
defining the set of components and how they interoperate in the framework shifting some
complexity up a level of abstraction. The core features of amsi used for multi-scale
                                                                       

                                                                       
simulation management and communication are provided with no requirements of
adherence to a specific component definition.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   simulation flow control is determined solely by the runtime system. A framework may
also limit specific features of the numerical implementation to those provided by the
framework. Domain discretization models and associated adaptive processes &#8211; structured
and unstructured meshing and associated refinement algorithms, particle-in-cell
methods, etc. &#8211; convergence algorithms for both the minimization of the relevant
residuals (Newton-Raphson, etc.) as well as iterative solution of the resulting linear
system (KSP, GMRES, ILU, etc.). Amsi supplies several numerical components
consisting of an adaptive finite element system, linear algebraic solver, and nonlinear
convergence operators available as both simple C++ class interface definitions, as well as
implementations built on top of other software supplied by SCOREC <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> and the PETSc
linear algebraic solver <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span>. Usage of the supplied numerical components
is not required to make use of the multi-scale meta-modeling, communication,
dynamic instantiation, and scale-sensitive load balancing facilities supplied by
amsi.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   While implementation of desired numerical operations into a framework is of course
possible, it may prove an additional undesirable overhead for an application programmer
interested only in utilizing the multi-scale framework to implement simulation, rather than
implementing the various numerical operations often perfected in widely available packages
and libraries <span class="cite">[]</span> <span class="cite">[]</span> <span class="cite">[]</span>.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   A configuration file is supplied during command invocation containing the initial
configuration of the process sets and their assignment to individual scales, as well as
declaring the coupling between scales in the simulation. The deceleration of a scale and the
initialization of the process set associated with the scale are considered a single atomic
operation in the current implementation.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Process sets are mathematical sets of MPI ranks implemented so as to take advantage
of any mathematical conveniences to minimize explicit storage whenever possible. Process
sets are required to be non-overlapping in order for amsi control mechanisms to operate
correctly. Ongoing developments are targeted at removing this requirement to allow a richer
set of dynamic control options and increase overall utilization in the case of coupled scales
blocking on one another.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Deceleration of a coupling relation between two scales is required if any communication
between the scales is to occur during the simulation (through the amsi libraries), as the
coupling deceleration during simulation initialization is used to instantiate data structures
specific to scale-coupling operations. This limits memory overhead by not allocating space
for unneeded coupling operations.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Scales are declared to be related if some quantities of interest (such as physical tensor
field values) are transmitted between them for scale-coupling. This coupling relationship is
assumed to be asymmetric, thus if scale A is related to scale B, scale B is not implicitly
related to scale A, though this may be separately declared. For brevity this may be written
as A&#x00A0;B for A is coupled to B.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   While the primary scale (the scale associated with producing the solution for the
overall simulation) is often thought of as controlling the tertiary scales in terms of dynamic
instantiation, this is not assumed in the amsi implementation. Any scale is capable of
informing the process set associated with a coupled scale of the addition or deletion of
individual scale-tasks. At present it is dependent on the developer to implement
the capability of a scale to accept additional scale-tasks, though algorithms and
hooks for developer-designed distribution algorithms are supplied to ease the
                                                                       

                                                                       
implementation.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Scale coupling communication is guided by data distributions and communication
patterns. A data distribution is a representation of individual units of scale-coupling
data distributed across a single scale-task. The format of the coupling data is
arbitrary (so long as it can be serialized and provided for use by MPI communication
primitives). A data distribution represents the smallest unit of data important to the
scale-coupling communication, which is necessarily distinct for various multi-scale use
cases.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   All communication and planning operations in the amsi libraries use an implicit local
numbering for data distribution terms, essentially denoted by the term&#8217;s index in a
serialized communication buffer.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   If a local installation of the Zoltan <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> <span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-10">?</span>]</span> load balancing library is available, the load
balancing planning algorithms of Zoltan can be used underlying the scale-sensitive load
balancing planning of amsi. A minimal set of load-balancing algorithms are provided with
amsi. Since there is no general solution to the dynamic load balancing problem
any set of provided load-balancing algorithms will prove insufficient for some
use case. Thus amsi provides users with the ability to create and register their
own load-balancing algorithms specific to the requirements of a given numerical
implementation.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Due to the necessity of retaining inter-scale linkages through the load-balancing
processes, the actual data migration undertaken to implement a specific load balancing plan
is typically conducted internally by the amsi system which is provided with buffers of data
being load-balanced by each process on the appropriate scale. However, in order to
maintain usability in more general situations, it is also possible to simply inform the amsi
system that the current load-balancing plan has already been accomplished by
user-implemented data migration. This functionality combined with the ability to use
user-designed load-balance planning algorithms allows amsi to work with entirely external
load-balancing libraries and algorithms, allowing scale-sensitive load-balancing to be used
even when a specific multi-scale use case falls outside the bounds of capabilities built into
the system.

<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   The incremental displacements (the displacement deltas generated by the previous
Newton iteration) on each engineering-scale finite element node are used to distort the a
dimensionless representative volume element (RVE) resulting in each micro-scale node
being displaced. Each RVE is a dimensionless unit cube containing a connected collagen
fiber network, for the present results the fibers are implemented as truss elements
and their distribution is generated using Delauney triangulation. The micro-scale
boundary condition necessitates that the force exerted by each fiber network node
located on the boundary of the RVE be zero. The micro-scale global Jacobian is
formulated along with the force vector, wherein the boundary condition is enforced
by setting specific rows of the force vector associated with boundary nodes to
zero.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Another Newton-Raphson iterative process occurs at micro-scale to converge to the set
of displacements resulting in force equilibrium for all the fibers within the fiber network
constituting the RVE. After a micro-scale simulation converges to a solution, the Jacobian
and force vector are then evaluated again at the solution position, the force exerted along
the boundary of the RVE is summed for each of the principal and shear components of a
stress tensor, which is then dimensionalized and sent back to the engineering-scale for use in
the elemental tangent stiffness matrix formulation. More detail into the derivation of this
multi-scale system can be found in <span class="cite">[<span

dimensionless force terms produced by each fiber network can be found in <span class="cite">[<span

<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Thus the simulation as a whole is essentially doubly nonlinear, as during each
engineering-scale Newton iteration every micro-scale RVE must undergo a full
Newton-Raphson convergence process.
<a 
 id="x1-8r4"></a>
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Scale-sensitive load balancing is conducted on the micro-scale RVE distribution at
locations in the code where communication bottlenecks are already present. This prevents
the introduction of new bottlenecks which could result in reduced performance. Macro-scale
Newton-iterations are the most frequently occuring multi-scale communication bottleneck
at which we chose to conduct the load balancing operation, and macro-scale incremental
load steps the least-frequent. These represent the two extreme cases considered in our
analysis on the efficacy of the scale-sensitive load-balancing scheme adopted for the
biotissue simulation.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   Each micro-scale RVE simulation involves the assembly and solve of a linear system of
equations on the order of 10,000 unknowns for each micro-scale Newton iteration. While the
total solve time is dependent on the number of nonlinear iterations and the hardware
executing the code, this system is sufficiently small that parallelization of the RVE code
itself is unwarranted, as the introduction of communication overhead into the RVE solution
process would result in decreased performance, despite the modest gain to computation
time. However, as each RVE represents an independent task to be accomplished by the
simulation, they may be freely distributed across the processes assigned to the micro-scale
computation. The only restriction to their (re)distribution for load balancing purposes is
that the relation to a specific macro-scale numerical integration point must be
maintained.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   As each RVE is a nonlinear simulation their is no a-prior estimate of the computational
load each RVE represents, so the optimal initial distribution is simply treating
the weight of each RVE as 1. Thus each micro-scale process is assigned either

reached, regardless of the granularity at which load-balancing is occuring for a
given case, each RVE has recorded the total number of newton iterations it has
conducted since the previous load-balancing event. This number is used as a heuristic
weighting metric to determine the computational load of each individual RVE. The
iteration count metric was chosen as each iteration takes a similar level of work to
complete, up to the difference in the number of RVEs for each unique fiber network.
Further, assuming linear incremental loading, regions in the engineering-scale
mesh located near stress concentrators will result in &#8217;more interesting&#8217; boundary
conditions for the micro-scale problems related to numerical integration points in
that region, which may result in the RVE requiring more Newton iterations to
converge to an adequate solution, since the boundary conditions may lie farther
from the initial state of the RVE in the regime of convergence for the nonlinear
problem.
